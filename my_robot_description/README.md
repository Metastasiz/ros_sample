Well I was going to write a brief documentation about this but unfortunately it is bedtime

    ros2 launch my_ros_bringup my_robot_gazebo.launch.xml
    rqt_graph

but these 2 commands should give some example of the functionality of the code for the areas below

# TransForm
# URDF
# Broadcast TF with Robot state Publisher
# XACRO
# Gazebo/Webot
